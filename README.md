# Gesture recognition program and knowledge distillation
This program is extension of [gesture_recognition_by_mmWave_and_AI](https://github.com/youron1115/gesture_recognition_by_mmWave_and_AI.git) that the target is to recognizing gesture after mmWave radar detecting it.
There are two models : regular gesture recognition model and knowledge distillation model. 
This program used wandb module to reord some details during training and evaluating.

## 1. Data collection
I recorded two gestures: "pipi","swipe left" and background using mmWave radar. This part is done by the original program(https://github.com/youron1115/gesture_recognition_by_mmWave_and_AI.git).
## 2. Data preprocessing

## 3. Model training

## 4. Model testing

# Knowledge distillation
Training and testing data of this part are testing data of the first part, other codes are in the knowledge_distillation directory.
